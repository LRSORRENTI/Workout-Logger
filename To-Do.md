# To Do List:

- Build UI for logging workouts / sets / reps 

- Render a list? How to structure list though? My pen and paper workout logs are just:
 ( Date - Activity )
 11-1-23 Leg day

 Followed by sets and reps with name of each 
 exercise: 

 Squats: 

Set 1: 245 x 10

so first set is 245 pounds with 
10 repetitions

How would I structure this to mimic my pen and paper logs? 

Add workout button first which will create a modal popup 
maybe asking for date, leg / ab day, back / biceps, chest / tri / shoulders, cardio day

Then that will create a list component maybe that will have 
an add exercise button, which has another modal asking 
for name of exercise like squat or calf raises, then the set and rep..

Should the main UI just be a calendar? Or maybe just render a calendar which will have references to those workout days 
and on click brings up info? 

Maybe start with just rendering a list?
